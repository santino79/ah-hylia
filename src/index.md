## Currently, I&rsquo;m a staff data scientist at  [Zapier](https://zapier.com).

I also write articles to help folks become better data analysts, and interview actual real-life data professionals, at [Analysts Assemble](https://analystsassemble.com).

And I help them get started learning SQL with my online [SQL Crash Course](https://sqlcrashcourse.com).


### Writers write.

I have previously been a [World Soccer editor](https://alanhylands.com/i-want-to-be-a-football-writer-when-i-grow-up/) for About.com and The New York Times Company, and had articles published in [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/becoming-an-analytics-manager-isnt-a-promotion-c3f65bbd0d95) and [Hacker Noon](https://hackernoon.com/fewer-dashboards-more-analysis-63581970672c).
